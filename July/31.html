        Second day journaling! School is about to start back up next week on tuesday and I also get my first paycheck from my job tommorow so that is super exciting! I don't know what
        I plan on spending that paycheck on but probably just school supplies and like maybe a gift for my friend since she gets me a lot of stuff! Ive been super bored at work these past
        couple of days considering there is absolutely no one that is gonna show up to a movie theater on a work day like thats only on the weekend that people show up to a movie theater.
        I did get my schedule fixed for the upcoming school year im gonna be super busy but hopefully I can keep up with everything! Homecoming is also coming soon and I do plan on asking
        someone coming up so we will see how that goes! I also have robotics coming up and thats also gonna keep me super busy. I am also gonna try to still go to the gym so thats another
        thing im gonna be busy with. Im gonna be super busy but these first couple of weeks are just gonna be a test trial to see if I can survive with this busy of a schedule. Back to 
        the person I am asking for homecoming I am still deciding if I do wanna ask them but there just super funky sometimes like some days there the best person ever and than the next 
        they just seem like they don't care anymore and I am merely just a burden so I don't know what's up with that! I have told her multiple times that she is really weird about it but
        like its also not my problem so I mean if she doesn't wanna talk to me or appreciate me than I don't have to do the same easy as that! I do know she likes me but I am not sure if 
        I wanna be with her considering there is so much differences between us and she isn't really good at showing anything or reciprocating anything so I am just like not sure! And it
        will also be more difficult to maintain cause just based on her reposts she wants me to do stuff that I can just not give her considering I am not mexican nor am I that much of
        an anime fan so yeah its very interesting! I dont know anymore fr tho cause like I know she likes me but I can't see what she would like in me and I am not sure if she would 
        actually wanna try to be with me considering how she already is normally! But yeah ill just keep it mutual between me and her than maybe ask her to homecoming we will see! Back 
        to school its gonna be very interesting considering I have not talked to barely any of my friends since the end of school and I am not sure if i wanna talk to them when I go back.
        I don't really have anything planned in my life or anything to work towards right now or wanna be a part of because I have just been trying to get to know this girl all summer and 
        its really drained me considering she just doesn't wanna be straight with me like I know she likes me but she doesn't wanna show it thats the only problem right there. But yeah 
        pretty much it just super drained and tired of everything and prolly gonna be even more drained with school starting back up so yeah just wish me luck!
