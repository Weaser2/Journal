        Hello welcome to my first day journal about my ever day life! I am Porter and I go by weaserman and deporte on the internet! If you know me I am probably known beacause of 
        interstellar or kxd! I play a lot of different games but mostly just story and horror games! I do play some fornite and roblox but that is only with my friends normally. 
        That's a basic introduction for me I don't do much with my every day life but hopefully going through my journal every day will help you understand who I am as a person and
        what I think mentally! Today I woke up around 7am and I went to the gym with my dad. At the gym I worked out legs and biceps today it was pretty rough considering I worked
        out legs yesterday also but its all good! After that I went home around 8am because me dad had a work related call at 8:30 and when I got home I took a shower and ate some pop
        tarts than doom scrolled for about an hour until around 10am I took a nap until 1am. At 1am I turned on my computer and thought what I wanted to do with my day. I decided I 
        wanted to make this website today which I think will help with my mental health that's has slowly fallen down since the begining of summer. I decided to play some roblox after 
        and I was playing a game called bhop and surf which is based around Counter Strike I believe and its a pretty fun movement based game. After that my best friend mikey/milo woke 
        up so I started talking with them. Even though they were just giving one word answers it is still nice to talk to someone sometimes. Sometimes I think I am really weird and weird
        and they don't actually wanna talk to me but thats what ever! It is cool that they listen thats it merely though. After that I decided to cook up a grilled cheese and I ate 
        that for lunch and while I was eating lunch I made a new playlist for me! If you wanna check it out 
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3MHTcFeQ32o7QcsckfdkDI?si=9a721e6f46b14d20">HERE</a> it is I think my music taste is pretty basic but if you like it that's cool!
        After that I started developing this website and I found a really cool minecraft font that I really love and decided to do that one and I think this website turned out half 
        decent.
